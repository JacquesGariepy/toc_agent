# Documentation for Testing Framework

## Description of the Problem

The provided Python code implements a basic testing framework that allows users to define test cases and execute them to verify if the actual outcomes of functions match the expected outcomes. This is beneficial for ensuring code correctness and reliability during development.

## Solution Logic

The framework consists of two primary classes: `TestCase` and `TestingFramework`.

1. **TestCase Class**: 
   - This class is used to define individual test cases. Each test case consists of:
     - A name to identify the test.
     - A test function that will return a result.
     - An expected outcome against which the result will be compared.
   - The `execute` method runs the test function and checks if the result matches the expected outcome, returning `True` for a pass and `False` for a failure.

2. **TestingFramework Class**: 
   - This class manages the execution of multiple test cases.
   - The `execute_tests` method iterates over a list of `TestCase` instances, executing each one and storing the results (either pass, fail, or any exception thrown during execution).
   - The `report` method prints out the results of the test cases in a readable format, indicating whether each test passed, failed, or encountered an error.

## Key Modules and Functions

### Classes

- **TestCase**: Represents a single test case.
  - **`__init__(self, name, test_function, expected_outcome)`**: Initializes a new test case with a name, function to test, and expected result.
  - **`execute(self)`**: Executes the test function and checks the outcome against the expected outcome.
  
- **TestingFramework**: Facilitates the execution of multiple test cases.
  - **`__init__(self)`**: Initializes an empty list to store test results.
  - **`execute_tests(self, test_cases)`**: Takes a list of `TestCase` instances and executes them, capturing results.
  - **`report(self)`**: Prints a summary report of all test outcomes.

### Example Test Functions

- **`sample_test()`**: A sample test function that returns the result of an addition operation (5 + 5).
  
- **`another_test()`**: Another sample test function that returns the result of a multiplication operation (2 * 3).

## Usage Examples

To use the testing framework, follow these steps:

1. Define test functions that will be tested. 
2. Create instances of the `TestCase` class with the test function and expected outcome.
3. Instantiate the `TestingFramework` class and execute the tests.
4. Generate and view the report of test outcomes.

### Example Code

```python
# Example test functions
def sample_test():
    return 5 + 5

def another_test():
    return 2 * 3

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_cases = [
        TestCase("Sample Test", sample_test, 10),  # This should pass
        TestCase("Another Test", another_test, 6),  # This should pass
    ]

    framework = TestingFramework()
    framework.execute_tests(test_cases)  # Execute all test cases
    framework.report()                    # Print the results
```

### Expected Output

When you run the code in the provided example usage, the expected output will be:

```
Test 'Sample Test': Passed
Test 'Another Test': Passed
```

This output indicates that both defined tests passed successfully, confirming that the actual outcomes matched their expected values.
